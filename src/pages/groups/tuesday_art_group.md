Tuesday Art group runs 6-30pm to 8pm â€“ 48 weeks of the year.

Pop-In art Group has been running for 22 years. Our group of dedicated artists have not only been able to develop their individual artist skills, but also work collaboratively together to create vibrant and colourful works of art that are exhibited at our yearly art exhibition and at the Pop-In Community Arts Festival. The exhibition within the arts festival gives our member artists a visible platform and voice in the community through the works displayed.
