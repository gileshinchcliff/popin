Saturday Pop-In Club runs 11am to 1pm â€“ 48 weeks of the year

Saturday club is a great day to come and join in on some fantastic activities that have been chosen by the members committee. The day usually run by some initial arts and crafts making or you can simply socialise and get a snack from the T-bar. This is then followed by a therapeutic wellbeing circle where generally everybody joins in with music dance movement or exercise workshops. And we always finish the day with a game of bingo called by one of our member bingo callers.
